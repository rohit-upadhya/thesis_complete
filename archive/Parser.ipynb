For that purpose it needs to establish its  \\njurisdiction  ratione personae  (ascertaining for example whether, in the context of an individual \\napplication , an applicant may be regarded as a “victim” for the purposes of  Article 34),  and its \\njurisdiction  ratione materia e (ascertaining for example whether the right relied upon is protected by  \\nthe Convention and protocols thereto  and whether the facts complained of fall within its scope ). The \\nCourt has repeatedly pointed ou t that it must satisfy itself that it has jurisdic tion in any case brought \\nbefore it and is therefore obliged to examine the question of its jurisdiction at every stage of the \\nproceedings  (see, for exa mple, Slovenia  v. Croatia  (dec.) [GC], 2020, or Svetova and Others  v. Russia , \\n2023, § § 23-28).

Further, \\nthe Convention does not merely oblige the higher authorities of the Contracting States themselves \\nto respect the rights and freedoms it embodies; it also has the consequence that, in order to secure \\nthe enjoyment of those ri ghts and freedoms, those authorities must prevent or remedy any breach \\nat subordinate levels. The higher authorities of the State are under a duty to require their \\nsubordinates to comply with the Convention and cannot shelter behind their inability to ensu re that \\nit is respected.  The general duty imposed on the State by Article 1 of the Convention entails and \\nrequires the implementation of a national system capable of securing compliance with the \\nConvention throughout the territory of the State for everyone . That is confirmed by the fact that, \\nfirstly, Article 1 does not exclude any part of the member States ’ “jurisdiction” from the scope of the \\nConvention and, secondly, it is with respect to t heir “jurisdiction” as a whole that member States are \\ncalled on t o show  compliance with the Convention.

The Commission a lso considered \\nwhether any  action  of the  United Kingdom  authorities  could have played a part in the applicant ’s \\nhusband ’s murder in the Republic  of Ireland , but found that the applicant  herself had at no point  \\nalleged  any such  action  on the  part of the British  authorities . Consequently , inasmuch as her \\ncomplaint concerned the  United Kingdom  and related to her husband ’s murder, it was  incompatible \\nratione loci  with the  Convention. On the other hand, her brother ’s murder in the United Kingdom  \\nhad bestowed  “jurisdiction” on that State, such that the corresponding complaint was indeed \\ncompatible  ratione loci  (W. v. the United Kingdom , Commission decision  of 28 February 1983 ). In the  \\nsecond  case, against  Ireland , the Commission reached diametrically  opposed  conclusions, to the \\neffect that the applicant ’s husband  had been within the  jurisdiction  of the respondent S tate, but not \\nher brother . In particular , as regard s the brother , the Commission a dded that the  constitutional \\nclaim to the  territories  of Northern Ireland  set out in A rticles  2 and 3 of the Irish  Constitution were \\nnot recognised by the international  community  as constitu ting the basis of  jurisdiction  over Northern \\nIreland  (W. v. Ireland , Commission decision  of 28 February 1983 ). \\n26.  The existence of a fence located some distance from the border does not authorise a State to \\nunilaterally exclude, alter or limit its territorial jurisdiction, which begins  at the line forming the \\nborder (N.D. and N.T. v. Spain  [GC], 2020, § 109). The case  cited  concerned the return to  Morocco  of \\ntwo persons, one a Malian  and the other an Ivoirian  national, who had attempted  to enter Spanish  \\nterritory  unlawfully by scaling  three parallel  fenc es surrounding the Spanish  enclave of Melilla, which \\nis located on the North African coast . The applic ants had man aged to reach only the top of the inner \\nfence, from which they had final ly climbed down with the help of the Spanish security forces , which \\nhad subsequently handed them over to the  Moroccan  authorities.

Conversely, in \\nconnection with the latter  period , the Court  reiterated  that it was not appropriate for it to assess \\nwhether and to what extent the “unification treaty”  of 21 March  2014 had changed the sovereign  \\nterritory  of either State in a manner  compatible with public international law . Nevertheless , it noted, \\nfirst of all, that Ukraine and Russia  had ratified  the Convention in respect of their  respective  \\nterritories  as delimited  by their  then international ly recognised  borders;  secondly, that neither of the \\nStates in question had notified  any changes to their  sovereign  territories ; and thirdly, that a number  \\nof States  and internationa l bodies had  refused  to recognise  any kind of  change  involving Crimea , \\naffecting the  territorial  integrity  of Ukraine under  international  law. Under those  circumstances , the \\nCourt  stated that the applicant  Government  had fa iled to put forward any arguments capable of \\nconvincing it that there had been any change to the sovereign  territory of either  party to  the \\nproceedings. For the purposes of the decision  on the admissibility  of the application, therefore, the \\nCourt  proceeded on the basis of the assumption that the jurisdiction of the respondent State over \\nCrimea  was in the form or nature of “effective control over an area” , as mentioned  above  (Ukraine  \\nv. Russ ia (re Crimea ) (dec.) [GC] , 2020, §§ 338-351). In short , the alleged victims of the \\nadministrative practice complained of by the applicant Government fell within the “jurisdiction” of \\nthe respondent State  (Ukraine  v. Russia (re Crimea ) (dec.) [GC] , 2020, § 352).  \\n3.  The relationship between A rticles 1 and 56 of the  Convention  \\n32.  Article 56 of the Convention, which is titled “Territorial  application ” (Article 63 before the  entr y \\ninto force of  Protocol  No. 11 in 1998), reads as follows : '}, {'number': 32, 'start': 4718, 'page_num': 11, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  12/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 2.  Transfers of sovereignty over  a given territory  \\n30.  Article 19 of the  Convention does not empower the  Cour t to deliver  a judgment on the \\nlawfulness and  validit y of a transfer  of territorial sover eignty under  international  law. However , the \\nCourt is empowered, in s o far as and only to the extent necessary for the exercise of its competence \\nunder Article 19 of the Convention to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by \\nthe High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, to determi ne the nature \\nof the jurisdiction exercised by a respondent State over a given territory . Indeed , the Court  must \\ninevitably  determine the question of transfer of sovereignty where the Convention provision alleged  \\nto have been breach ed comprises  a reference to the provisions  of domestic law . Under its \\nestablished case -law, the  Court  must examine the provisions  of domestic law in considering the \\nmerits of a complaint, and therefore it must determine  what the applicable “domestic ” law is \\n(Ukraine  v. Russi a (re Crimea ) [GC] (d ec.), 2020, §§ 341-342).  \\n31.  The Court  examined the admissibility of an  inter -State case against  Russia  in which the Ukrainian  \\nGovernment  had raised a series  of complaints concerning events  which had occurred  between  27 \\nFebruary  2014 a nd 26 August  2015; in the  course  of those  events  the Crimea n region  (including the \\ncity of  Sebastopol ) had been incorporated  into the Russian  Federation . In that connection the  Court  \\nfollowed the  approach  adopted by the I nternational Court  of Justice, various internationa l arbitral \\ntribunals and the Swiss  Federal  Court , declaring  that i t was not called upon to decide in the abstract \\non the “legality” under  international law of what had been presented as the  “annex ation of Crimea ” \\nor of the resultant  legal  status  of that  territory . Those matters had not been referred to the Court \\nand did not th erefore constitute the subject matter of the dispute before it (Ukraine  v. Russia (re \\nCrimea ) (dec.) [GC] , 2020, §§ 243-244 and 339). The Court  examined the  question of the respondent \\nState ’s “jurisdiction” , dealing separately  with two different  periods : the period  preceding  18 March  \\n2014, when the Russian  Federation , the “Republic  of Crimea ” and the City of Sebastopol  had signed \\na “unification treaty”  incorporating  Crimea  into Russia , and the period  since that  date.

I t is different if the ind ividual has a connection with the country \\nin question . \\n37.  Thus, e ven if the events at the origin of a  court case  occurred outside the territory  of the \\nrespondent S tate, where a person  brings a civil action concerning those events before  the courts of \\nthat S tate there is an undeniable  “jurisdictional  link” for the purposes of A rticle 1 of the  Convention, \\nto the extent that the rights secured under A rticle 6 § 1 are at stake  – obviously without  prejudic e to \\nthe outcome  of proceedings  (Marković  and Others  v. Italy  [GC] , 2006, § 54; see also  Chagos Islanders  \\nv. the United Kingdom  (dec.), 2012, § 66). Indeed , if the domestic law recognises a right to bring an \\naction and if the right claimed is one which prima facie possesses the character istics required by \\nArticle 6 of the Convention, the Court sees no reason why such domestic proceedings should not be \\nsubjected to the same level of scrutiny as any other proceedings brought at the national level . Even \\nthough the extraterritorial nature of the events alleged to have been at the origin of an action may \\nhave an effect on the applicability of Article 6 and the final outcome of the proceedings, it cannot \\nunder any circumstances affect the jurisdiction ratione loci  and ratione personae  of the Sta te \\nconcerned. If civil proceedings are brought in the domestic courts, the State is required by Article 1 \\nof the Convention to secure in those proceedings respect for the rights protected by Article 6 \\n(Marković  and Others  v.

In th e cited  case , the Court  had examined  the \\nobjection as to  incompatibility  ratione loci raised by the respondent  Government , to the effect that \\nthe civil action brought by the applic ants before  the Italian  court s had concerned  events  of an  \\nextraterritorial nature (an air strike by NATO  forces in the Federal  Republic  of Yugoslavia ). \\n38.  Similarly, if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State i nstitute their own \\ncriminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction \\nof that State, by virtue of their domestic law (e.g. under provisions on universal jurisdiction or on the \\nbasis of the active or passive  personality principle), the institution of that investigation or those \\nproceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that \\nState and the victim ’s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court (Güzelyurtlu  and Others  \\nv. Cyprus and Turkey  [GC], 2019, § 188; see also  Ukraine and the Netherlands  v. Russia  [GC] (d ec.), \\n2022, § 559).  This approach is also in line with the nature of the procedural obligation to carry out an \\neffective investigation under Article 2, which has evolved into a separate and autonomous \\nobligation, albeit triggered by acts in relation to the substantive aspect s of that provision. In this \\nsense it can be considered to be a detachable obligation arising out of Article 2 and capable of \\nbinding the State even when the death occurred outside its jurisdiction (ibid., § 189, and the \\nreferences  therein ).

The applicants had alleged a  violation of A rticle 3 of the  \\nConvention ( prohibition o f degrading treatment ) and A rticle 3 § 2 of Protocol  No. 4 (right to enter \\nthe State of one ’s nationality ). The French authorities had brought proceedings against the \\ndaughters for participating in a terrorist association ; however , the Court took the view that those \\nproceedings had no bearing on whether the facts complained of under Article 3 of the Convention \\nand Article  3 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 fell within France ’s jurisdiction.

In the case of  Aliyeva and Aliyev  v. Azerbaijan , 2014, the Court  had before it an application from \\nthe parents of an  Azerbaijani  national who had been killed in Ukraine under  circumstances  \\nimplicating  two other  Azerbaijani  national s. Pursuant  to a mutual legal assistance agreement \\nbetween Ukraine and Azerbaijan , the case had been  transmitted  to Azerbaijan , but in the absence of \\nevidence the  Azerbaijani  authorities  had discontinued the proceedings  against the  suspect s. The \\nCourt  raised  of its own motion  the issue of its jurisdiction  ratione loci , considering  that in so far as  \\nAzerbaijan  had accepted  the obligation to conduct an investigation under  the 1993 Minsk \\nConvention to continue the criminal investigation commenced by the Ukrainian authorities, it was \\nbound to conduct such an investigation in compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2  \\nand had undertaken  to continue  the criminal investigation  commenc ed by the  Ukrainian  authoritie s, \\nregardless  of where the death had occurred . Therefore, the  jurisdiction  of Azerbaijan  within the \\nmeaning of A rticle  1 came into play only to the extent that the  Azerbaijani  authorities  had decided  to \\ntake o ver the proceedings previously  opened by  Ukraine, under the  applicable international treaty \\nand domestic law (§§ 55-57). \\n43.  In the case of  Güzelyurtlu  and Others  v. Cyprus and Turkey  [GC], 2019, conce rning the murders \\nof several former residents  of the  “Turkish  Republic  of Northern Cyprus ” (“TRNC”) in the  territory of \\nthe Republic of Cyprus , the TRNC  authorities  had initiated their own investigation  into those \\nmurders , thus creating a  “jurisdictional  link” between the applic ants and Turkey , which incurred the \\nlatter ’s responsibility  vis-à-vis the acts and omissions of the “TRNC ” authorities . Moreover , there \\nwere “special features” related to the situation in Cyprus . First of all , the international community \\nregards Turkey as being in occupation of the northern part of Cyprus , and does not recognise the \\n“TRNC” as a State under international law. Northern  Cyprus is under the effective control of Turkey \\nfor the purposes of the Convent ion. Second ly, the murder suspects had fled to the “TRNC” and as a \\nconsequence, the Republic of Cyprus had been prevented from pursuing its own criminal \\ninvestigation in respect of those suspects and thus from fulfilling its Convention obligations . Having \\nregard to those “speci al features ” and to  the initiation of the investigation by the “TRNC”  \\nauthorities , the Court considered  that Turkey ’s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention was \\nestablished  (ibid., §§ 191-197).  \\n44.  In the case of  Romeo Castaño  v. Belgium , 2019, the applic ants com plained  of the Belgian  \\nauthorities ’ refusal  to execute  a European  Arrest Warrant issued by the Spanish  authorities  against  a \\nperson suspected  of having been a member of the ETA terrorist  organisation , who had allegedly  \\nbeen involved in the murder of the  applicants ’ father in Spain and who lived  in Belgium , thus \\nprevent ing the commencement of criminal  proceedings against h er in  Spain .

While taking part in a training course in Hungary, an Azerbaijani officer \\ndecapitated an Armenian officer and threatened to kill another Armenian soldier. He was sentenced '}, {'number': 48, 'start': 1671, 'page_num': 17, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  18/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 to life imprisonment in Hungary. The ethnic bias in respect of his crimes was fully investigated and \\nhighlighted by the Hungarian courts. Having served eight years of his sentence in Hungary, he was \\ntransferred to Azerbaijan under the Council of Europe Convention on Transfer of Sentenced \\nPersons  (“the Transfer Convention”) with a view to serving the remainder of his sentence in his \\nhome country. However, upon his return he was welcomed as a hero, immediately released, \\npardoned, promoted at a public ceremony and awarded arrears in salary for the period spent in \\nprison as well as the use of a flat. Many comments approving his conduct and pardon were made by \\nvarious high -ranking Azerbaijani officials.  The Court reiterated that the enforcement of a sentence \\nimposed in the context of the right to life had to be regarded as an integral part of th e State ’s \\nprocedural obligation under Article 2. Regardless of where the crimes were committed, in so far as \\nAzerbaijan had agreed to and assumed the obligation under the Transfer Convention to continue the \\nenforcement of the prison sentence commenced by t he Hungarian authorities, it was bound to do \\nso, in compliance with its procedural obligations under Article  2. In sum , there were sufficient \\n“special features” in the case to trigger the existence of Azerbaijan ’s jurisdictional link in relation to \\nthose p rocedural obligations  (Makuchyan and Minasyan  v. Azerbaijan and Hungary , 2020, § § 50-51). \\n48.  All the above -mentioned  cases concerned  criminal proceedings  which were ( or should have \\nbeen) commenced at the initiative of the authorities  of a Contracting  State in the framework of its \\nprocedural obligations under Article  2 of the Convention. On the other hand, that reasoning  does \\nnot apply to the very different  case of administrative  proceedings  – for example  proceedings  aimed \\nat obtaining  a visa – brought  by an individual without any pre-existing  connection wi th the S tate in \\nquestion, where the choice  of that particular S tate was not  impose d under any treaty obligation. In \\nparticulier,  as regards  immigration, the Court  has held that to find otherwise would  amount to \\nenshrining a near -universal application of the Convention on the basis of the unilateral choices of \\nany individual, irrespective of where in the world they find themselves, and therefore to create an \\nunlimited obligation on the Contracting State s to allow entry to an individual who might be at risk of \\nill-treatment contrary to the Convention outside their jurisdiction. If the fact that a State Party rules \\non an immigration application is sufficient to bring the individual making the application u nder its \\njurisdiction, precisely such an obligation would be created. The individual in question could create a \\njurisdictional link by submitting an application and thus give rise, in certain scenarios, to an \\nobligation under Article 3 which would not othe rwise exist  (M.N. and Others  v. Belgium  (dec.) [GC],  \\n2020, § 123; Abdul Wahab Khan  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.), 2014, § 27). Such an extension of the \\nConvention ’s scope of application would also have the effect of negating the well -established \\nprinciple of public international law, recognised by the Court, according to which the States Parties, \\nsubject to their treaty obligations, inclu ding the Convention, have the right to control the entry, \\nresidence and expulsion of aliens (M.N. and Others  v. Belgium  (dec.) [GC],  2020, § 124, and the case -\\nlaw cited therein ). The Court reached the same  conclusion on the subject of proceedings brought \\nbefore the French urgent applications judge , on behalf of French applicants detained abroad, \\nseeking their repatriation  (H.F. and Others  v. France  [GC], 2022, § § 195-196).  \\n5.  The particular case of  Article 3 § 2 of Protocol  No. 4 \\n49.  Article 3 § 2 of Protocol  No. 4 provides as follows : \\n“No one shall be deprived of the right to enter the territory of the State of which he is a national .” \\n50.  In the case of  H.F. and Others  v. France  [GC], 2022,  the Court was called upon for the first time \\nto rule on the  existence of a jurisdictional link between a State and its nationals  in respect of a \\ncomplaint  raised under that provision .

The very re ality of armed confrontation and fighting between enemy military forces seeking  to \\nestablish control over an area in a context of chaos means that there is no control over an area .

In that connection, the  Court  contraste d isolated and specific acts \\ninvolving an element of pr oximity (such as fire aimed by the armed forces/police of the States  \\nconcerned, to which the concept of  “State agent authority and control” could be applied ; see \\nbelow ), with bombing and artillery shelling by a belligerent  State seeking to put the enemy  hors de \\ncombat  and to establish control over a given area . Furthermore , the interpretation  of Article 1 of the  \\nConvention as precluding the State ’s “jurisdiction”  during the  active phase of  hostilities  in the \\nforeign  territo ry is borne out by the  practice  of the High Contracting Parties in not derogating under \\nArticle 15 of the Convention in situations where they have engaged in an international armed \\nconflict outside their own territory. This may be interpreted as the High C ontracting Parties \\nconsidering that in such situations, they do not exercise jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 \\n(ibid. , §§ 125-139).  \\n60.  Conversely, military occupation after the cessation of active hostili ties can bestow jurisdiction \\non the “active” State on the basis of its effective control over the territory in question and/or specific \\nindividuals ( Georgia  v. Russia (II) , 2021, §§ 161-175).  \\nb.  The “passive ” State sustaining a foreign military  operation  in its  territory  \\n61.  By the same  logic , even where the  “passive ” State (sustaining a foreign  military  operation  in its \\nown  territory ) still formal ly holds  “jurisdiction ” over its whole territory  in accordance  with A rticle 1 \\nof the  Convention, normal exercise  of such  jurisdiction  during the  active phase of  hostilities  may be \\nso impeded that the Court  will declare  the relevant complaints inadmissible. Clearly, the Court ’s \\ncase -law shows that  the “passive ” State is still required to adopt diplomatic , judicial , political  or \\nadministrative  measures  to en sure respect for individual  right s. On the other hand , it would b e \\nunrealistic  to require the  national  authorities  to do so during the  active phase of  hostilities , in a \\ngeneral situation of chao s and  confus ion. Given the ongoing massive armed conflict, such positive \\nmeasures were, on the one hand, impossible to implement and, on the other, of no real value, as \\nthey could not have meaningfully contributed to the protection of the applicants ’ rights \\n(Shavlokhova and Others  v. Georgia  (dec.), 2021, § § 32-34; Bekoyeva and Others  v. Georgia  (dec.), \\n2021, § § 37-39). \\nc.  General  observation  and further developments  \\n62.  In the case of  Georgia  v. Russia (II) , 2021, t he Court  recognised  that such an interpretation of the \\nnotion of “jurisdiction” in Article 1 of the Convention might seem unsatisfactory to the alleged \\nvictims of acts and omissions by a respondent State during the active phase of hostilities in the \\ncontext of an international armed conflict outside its territory but in the territory of another \\nContracting State, as well as to the State in whose territory the active host ilities have taken place . \\nNevertheless , having regard in particular to the large number of alleged victims and contested \\nincidents, the magnitude of the evidence produced, the difficulty in establishing the relevant \\ncircumstances and the fact that such sit uations were  predominantly regulated by legal norms other \\nthan those of the Convention  (specifically, international humanitarian law or the law of armed \\nconflict), the Court was not in a position to develop its case -law beyond the understanding of the \\nnotion of “jurisdiction” as established to date . If the Court were to be entrusted  with the task of \\nassessing acts of war and active hostilities in the context of an international armed conflict outside \\nthe territory of a respondent State, it was for the Contr acting Parties to provide the necessary legal \\nbasis for such a task .

The Court had therefore been able to \\nrefer to “the five -day war” as a distinct “active phase of hostilities” and to separate out complaints \\nwhich it had identified as concerning “military operations carried out during the active phase of \\nhostilities”. It had summarised the alleged attacks falling under this head as covering “bombing, \\nshelling and artillery fire”.

In order to \\ndetermine whether the Convention applies to an individual case , the Court must examine whether \\nany exceptional circumstances actually exist relating to the nature of the connection between the \\napplicant and the respondent State, such as to  show  whether the latter effectively exercised \\nauthority or control over him or her (M.N. and Others  v.

Unlike jurisdiction based on effective control over an area, the Court has on numerous occasions \\nfound personal jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention to exist outside the Convention legal \\nspace  (see, among other examples , Öcalan , Medvedyev and Others , Al-Skeini and Others  and Jaloud , \\ntogether with  Ukraine and the Netherlands  v.

It had summarised the alleged attacks falling under this head as covering “bombing, \\nshelling and artillery fire”.

Conversely, t he Court  left open  the question  whether a bi national  (or a national of several  \\ndifferent  States) detained  in one of the S tates whose  nationality  he or she held fell under the \\njurisdiction  of the other S tate where the latter  refused  to afford h im o r her diplomatic  protection or \\nconsular  assistance (indeed , pursuant to a provision  of customary international law relied on by the \\nnational  authorities , a S tate cannot afford  diplomatic  protection to one of its  nationa ls in respect of \\na State which he  or she is also a national ). Thus the  Court  rejected  as manifest ly ill -founded  a \\ncomplaint submitted by a  Belgian-Moroccan  binational concerning a refus al by the Belgian  \\nauthorities  to grant him consular  assistance during  his detention in Morocco . Even supposing that a \\npositive obligation to act could have been  deduced from the provisions  of the  Convention, the Court  \\nnoted that the Belgian  authorities  had by no means remained passive or indifferent . The failure of \\ntheir ap proaches to the  Moroccan  authorities had been the result  not of their own  inertia  but of the \\ncategorical  rejection of their requests by the  Moroccan  authorities, who at the time had had \\nexclusive control  over the applic ant ( Aarrass  v.

The Court  found that  Belgium  had no jurisdiction  over four  Syrian  national s who had  \\nunsuccessfully  applied for  visas at the Belgian  Embassy in  Lebanon , relying on the  risk of ill -\\ntreatment  in their country of  origin . First of all , the applic ants  were  not Belgian nationals seeking to \\nbenefit from the protection of their embassy. Secondly, at no time did the diplomatic agents \\nexercise de facto  cont rol over the applicants. The latter freely chose to present themselves at the \\nBelgian embassy in Beirut, and to submit their visa applications there – as indeed they could have \\nchosen to approach any other embassy; they were then free to leave the premises  of the Belgian \\nembassy without any hindrance (M.N. and Others  v.

In this \\nconnection, it is irrelevant that the diplomatic agents had, as in the present case, merely a “letter \\nbox” role, or to ascertain who was responsible for taking the decisions, whether the Belgian \\nauthorities in the national territory or the diplomat ic agents posted abroad (ibid., § 114).  \\n71.  In the case of  H.F. and Others  v.

In s o far as the applicants had alleged a  violation of Article 3 of the  Convention \\n(allegation of ill -treatment in the  camps), the Court found that France did not have jurisdiction, \\nwhich could not be triggered by the nationality of those concerned or France ’s refusal to repatriate \\nthem . Such an extension of the Convention ’s scope found no support in the case -law. First, the mere \\nfact that decisions taken at national level had had an impact on the situation of individuals residing \\nabroad was not such as to establish the jurisdiction of the State concerned over them outside its \\nterritory .

Acts  committed  on board a ship or aircraft  \\n72.  In addition  to acts performed by  diploma tic and consular  agents, other recognised instances of \\nthe extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by a State include cases involving the activities of its \\ndiplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board aircraft and ships registered in, or flying the flag \\nof, that State. In these specific situations, customary international law and treaty provisions have \\nclearly recognised and defined the extraterritorial exercise of jurisdiction by the relevant State \\n(Cyprus  v. Turkey , Commission decision  of 26 May 1975 ; Banković and Others  v. Belgium and Others  \\n(dec.)  [GC],  2001, § 73; Medvedyev and Others  v. France  [GC],  2010, § 65); Bakanova  v. Lithuania , \\n2016, § 63; Hirsi Jamaa  and Others  v. Italy  [GC], 2012, § 75). \\nd.  Exercise  of another State ’s sovereign authority with its agreement  \\n73.  The Cour t has recognised the exercise of extra -territorial jurisdiction by a Contracting State \\nwhich, through the consent, invitation or acquiescence of the local Government, exercises all or \\nsome of the public powers normally to be exercised by that Government  (Banković and Others  \\nv. Belgium and Others  (dec.)  [GC],  2001, § 71). Consequently , where, in accordance with custom, \\ntreaty or other agreement,  authorities of the Contracting State carry out executive or judicial \\nfunctions on the territory of another State, the Contracting State may be responsible for breaches of \\nthe Convention thereby incurred, as long as the acts in question are attributable to  it rather than to \\nthe territorial State (Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  2011, § 135). \\n74.  As regards extradition, when a S tate issues a European  arrest warrant or and international arrest  \\nwarrant  issued by  Interpol for the purposes  of enforcing the detention  of a  person  located in \\nanother  State and the latter executes  the warrant pursuant to its  international  obligations , the \\nrequesting  State is responsible  under the  Convention  for such  detention , even if it was  executed  by \\nthe other S tate (Vasiliciuc  v. the Republic  of Moldova , 2017, §§ 23-24; Stephens  v. Malta (no. 1) , \\n2009, §§ 51-54). Where the  arrest  warrant comp rises a  technical  irregularity  which the authorities  of \\nthe requested  State could not have detected , the requesting S tate shoul d be ascribed  responsibility  \\nunder the Convention for the unlawful  arrest  warrant issued by its  authorities  pursuant to its  \\ndomestic  law and  executed  by the other S tate in compliance with its  international  obligations (ibid. , \\n§ 52). \\n75.  The Commission dealt with a situation of that  type in the case of  X. and Y.  v. Switzerland  \\n(Commission decision  of 14 July 1977 ). In that case a German  national  complained  about a \\nprohibition  on entr y imposed on  him by the Swiss Federal  authorities , with  effect  both in Swiss  \\nterritory  and in Liechtenstein ( which, at the time , had  not yet  ratified the  Convention and therefore \\nlay outside the scope of the latter ). The decisive  point for the  Commission  was that under an \\nagreement between Switzerland  and Liechtenstein , the latter was debar red from exclu ding the  \\neffects  of an  entr y ban imposed by the Swiss  authorities , whereby only the latter authorities  were \\nentitled to exclude  Liechtenstein from the territorial  scop e of such a measure . In those  conditions, \\nSwitzerland  should be deemed  resp onsible  not only for the  legal procedure  and consequences  of the \\nprohibition  on entr y into its own territory , but also for the effects  produced  by that prohibition  in \\nLiechtenstein. Indeed , in conform ity with the specific relations hip between those two countries, in \\nacting on behalf of Liechtenstein the Swiss  authorities  were actual ly acting in accordance  with  their \\nnational  jurisdiction . According to the agreement  in question, they were acting exclusive ly in \\npursuance of Swiss law, and it was merely the  effect  of their actions  which extended  to Liechtenstein  \\nterritory . In other words, the prohibition had been imposed under Swiss  jurisdiction , which  had been  \\nextended  to Liechtenstein.

Use of  force by a S tate’s agents operating  outside its territory  \\n79.  In some cases, the use of force by a State ’s agents operating  outside its territory  – whether \\nlawfully or unlawfully  – may bring the individual thereby brought under the control of the Sta te’s \\nauthorities into the State ’s Article 1 jurisdiction (Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  \\n2011, § 136). A typical example  of such a case is where an individual has been handed over to  a \\nState ’s agents outside its territory , even if they are only presumed agents ( Razvozzhayev  v. Russia \\nand Ukraine and Udaltsov  v. Russ ia, 2019, § 161). Similarly, the control  exercised over an individual \\non account of an incursion or a targeted  operation  by the  armed  forces or the police of a S tate \\noperating  beyond its own borders might be  sufficient  to bring the affected persons under the \\nauthority and/or effective control of that State, particularly as such targeted violations of the human \\nrights of an individual by one Contracting State in the territory of another Contracting  State \\nundermine the eff ectiveness of the Convention both as a guardian of human rights and as a \\nguarantor of peace, stability and the rule of law in Europe (Carter  v. Russia , 2021, § § 127-128). In \\nCarter , that principle  was appli ed to a premeditated , targeted  extrajudicial  killing by  agents of one \\nState acting in the  territory  of another S tate outside the context  of a  military  operation (Carter  \\nv. Russi a, 2021, § 130). In situations of that kind , the Court  has emphasised that Article 1 of the \\nConvention cannot be interpreted so as to allow a State party to perpetrate violations of the \\nConvention on the territory of another State, which it could not perpe trate on its own territory (Issa \\nand Others  v. Turkey , 2004, § 71). \\n80.  The Court thus acknowledged that the applic ants were under the  “jurisdiction ” of the relevant \\nrespondent States in the following situations : \\n▪ The applic ant, the leader of the  PKK ( the Kurdistan  Workers ’ Party ), who had been arrested  \\nby Turkish  security  agents in the international zone  of Nairobi airport  (Kenya) and flown \\nback to  Turkey . The Court  noted  – and the Turkish Government  did not dispute  – that, \\ndirectly after being handed over to the Turkish officials by the Kenyan officials, the \\napplicant was effectively under Turkish authority and therefore within the “jurisdiction” of \\nthat State, even though in this instance Turkey exercised its authority outside its territory. \\nIt is true that the applicant was physically forced to return to Turkey by Turkish  officials and \\nwas under their authority and control following his arrest and return to Turkey (Öcalan  \\nv. Turkey  [GC],  2005, § 91). \\n▪ The appl icants, two Iraqis  who had been charged  with involvement in the murder of two \\nBritish soldiers  shortly after the  invasion of Iraq in 2003, been held in a British detention  \\nfacility near  Baghdad, and had complained  that their  imminent handover  to the Iraqi  \\nauthorities  would expose them to a  real risk of execution by hanging . The Court  held that \\ninasmuch as the control  exercised by the United Kingdom  over its military detention \\nfacilities in  Iraq and the individuals held there had been  absolute  and exclusive  de facto \\nand de jure , the applicants should be deemed to have been within  the respondent State ’s \\njurisdiction  (Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.) , 2009, §§ 86-89). \\n▪ The applicants, crew members of a cargo ship registered in Cambodia and intercepted off \\nthe Cape Verde islands by the French navy under suspicion of transporting large quantities \\nof drugs, were confined to their quarters under military guard until the ship ’s arrival in \\nBrest. The Court found that as France had exercised full and exclusive control over the ship \\nand its crew, at least de facto , from the time of its interception, in a continuous and \\nuninterrupted manner until they were tried in France, the applica nts had been effectively \\nwithin France ’s jurisdiction for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention ( Medvedyev and \\nOthers  v. France  [GC], 2010, § 67). The Court reached the same conclusion in a case \\nconcerning a group of Greenpeace activists confined to their ship, which had been \\nintercepted by the Russian coastguard and escorted to the Russian port of Mourmansk \\n(Bryan and Others  v.

The evidence of premeditation strongly indicated that the \\nvictim ’s death had been  the result of a planned and complex operation; he had not been an \\naccidental victim of the operatio n and he could not have ingested polonium 210 by accident . \\nAccordingly , the  Court  found that the  victim  had been under the physical control of the two Russian  \\nagents, who had had  power over his life, thus establishing a sufficient jurisdictional link for t he \\npurposes of Article  1 of the Convention (Carter  v. Russia , 2021, § § 158-161 and § 170).  \\n84.  Whenever the State, through its agents, exercises control and authority , and thus jurisdiction, \\nover an individual , the State is under an obligation under Article 1 to secure to that individual the \\nrights and freedoms under Section I of the Convention that a re relevant to the situation of that \\nindividual. In this sen se, therefore, the Convention rights can be “divided and tailored” (Al-Skeini and \\nOthers  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  2011, § 137); Hirsi Jamaa  and Others  v. Italy  [GC], 2012, § 74); \\nCarter  v. Russia , 2021, § 126) . \\nf.  Other situations  \\n85.  There can be other  situations where the  nature of the  link between the applic ant and the \\nrespondent S tate are such as to permit a finding that that State had indeed exerc ised its  authority  or \\ncontrol  over the applic ant. Thus the  Court  found that the drowning of an underage Mold ovan \\nnational during his stay in a summer camp  in Romania  had fallen  under the  jurisdiction  of Moldova, \\nsince his stay on the Romanian  coast had been  organised  by the  Mold ovan Ministry  of Youth and  \\nSport  and that Ministry  had appointed and  mandated  three  of its officials  as group  leaders \\nresponsible  for the young people. Furthermore , it did not transpire  from the case file that any \\nRomanian  officials  had been involved in looking after the young Mold ovans , including the  victim  \\n(Veronica Ciobanu  v. the Republic of Moldova , 2021, § 26). \\n3.  Power  exerc ised in a specific  territory  \\n86.  As regards  the “effective control” principle of jurisdiction over a specific territory, it should be \\nnoted from the outset that that principle  does not replace  the system of declarations under \\nArticle  56 of the Convention (formerly Article 63) which the States decided, when drafting the \\nConvention, to apply to territories overseas for whose international relations they we re responsible. \\nArticle 56 § 1 provides a  mechanism whereby any State may decide to extend the application of the \\nConvention, “with due regard ... to local requirements”, to all or any of the territories for whose \\ninternational relations it is responsible. The existence of this mechanism, which w as included in the \\nConvention for historical reasons, cannot be interpreted in present conditions as limiting the scope \\nof the term “jurisdiction” in Article 1. The situations covered by the “effective control” principle are \\nclearly separate and distinct f rom circumstances where a Contracting State has not, through a \\ndeclaration under Article 56, extended the Convention or any of its Protocols to an overseas territory \\nfor whose international relations it is responsible (Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  \\n2011, § 140; Cyprus  v. Turkey , Commission decision  of 26 May 1975 ). \\n87.  The Convention is a constitutional instrument of European public order. It does not govern the \\nactions of States not Parties to it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting \\nStates to impo se Convention standards on such other States (Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United \\nKingdom  [GC],  2011, § 141). Clearly, therefore , in the two situations  mentioned  above , the Court ’s \\njurisdiction  ratione personae  can only  extend  to one S tate Party  to the  Convention.

Where the Court establishes that the facts of the case are within the respondent State ’s \\n“jurisdiction”, the  latte r has two main obligations:  \\n▪ a negative  obligation to refrain from actions incompatible with the  Convention ( Ilaşcu and \\nOthers  v.

The Court has never said that there can only be effective control over an area outside a State ’s \\nsovereign borders if the area in question falls within the territory of one of the High Contracting \\nParties. However, this would appear to be the ratio nale behind its conclusion that the controlling \\nState should in principle be held to account for all breaches of negative and positive obligations \\nunder the Convention within the controlled territory. After all, as the Court has explained, to hold \\notherwis e would be to deprive the population of that territory of the rights and freedoms previously \\nenjoyed and to which they are entitled, and would result in a vacuum of protection within the legal \\nspace  of the Convention. It has moreover emphasised that the Co nvention is a constitutional \\ninstrument of European public order: it does not govern the actions of States which are not Parties \\nto it, nor does it purport to be a means of requiring the Contracting States to impose Convention \\nstandards on other States. Th e Court has accordingly concluded that extraterritorial ratione loci  \\njurisdiction existed in a number of such cases concerning territory inside the Convention legal space . \\nHowever, t o date, the Court has never found there to be extraterritorial jurisdictio n on account of \\nratione loci  jurisdiction over an area outside the sovereign territory of the Council of Europe member \\nStates  (Ukraine and the Netherlands  v. Russia  [GC] (d ec.), 2022,  §§ 562-563).  \\n95.  The question whether a Contracting  State is  genuinely  exerc ising  effective  control  over a \\nterritory  outside its borders is one of fact. In seeking to answer that question  the Court  primarily has \\nregard  to the following two  criteria : \\n▪ the number  of soldiers  deployed  by the S tate in the  territory  in question ; this is the  \\ncriterion  to which the  Court  had hitherto attached the greatest  importance (Loizidou  \\nv. Turkey  (merits ), 1996, §§ 16 and 56 ; Ilaşcu and Others  v. Moldova and Russia  [GC], 2004, \\n§ 387); \\n▪ the extent to which the State ’s military, economic and political support for the local \\nsubordinate administration provides it with influence  and control over the region (ibid., \\n§§ 388-394; Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2011, § 139).  \\n96.  Where the Court establishes that the facts of the case are within the respondent State ’s \\n“jurisdiction”, the  latte r has two main obligations:  \\n▪ a negative  obligation to refrain from actions incompatible with the  Convention ( Ilaşcu and \\nOthers  v. Moldova and Russia  [GC], 2004, §§ 320-321);  \\n▪ a positive obligation to guarantee  respect for the righ ts and freedoms secured under the  \\nConvention – at least as set out in the Court ’s general  case -law (ibid., § 322).  \\n97.  The cases considered by the  Court  in the light of the above -mentioned principles  may be broken  \\ndown into two sub -categories : \\na. cases  concerning  military  “occupation ” in the traditional  sense  as defined  in Article  42 of \\nthe Hague  Convention respect ing the Laws and Customs  of War on Land , which reads as \\nfollows: “territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of '}, {'number': 98, 'start': 627, 'page_num': 30, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  31/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 the hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has \\nbeen e stablished and can be exercised” ; \\nb. cases  concerning the  creation , within the  territory of a Contracting State , of an  entity  \\nwhich is not recognised by the  international  community as a  sovereign State , with the  \\nmilitary , economic and  political support of another Contracting State . \\ni.  “Traditional” military occupation  \\n98.  The question of the  occup ying power ’s responsibility  in the framework of “traditional” military  \\noccupation arose in a number of cases  concerning  Iraq. On 20 March  2003  the armed  forces of the \\nUnited State s, the United Kingdom  and their  allies  entered  Iraq with a view to overthrowing the \\nBa’athist  regime  in power at the time . On 1 May  2003  the allies  declared  that the primary combat \\noperations  were completed, and the United State s and the  United Kingdom  became  the occup ying \\npowers . They set up the Coalition Provisional  Authority  to “exercise powers of government \\ntemporarily ”, including restoring  security  in Iraq. The security  role taken on by the  occup ying powers \\nwas recognised  in Resolution  1483 of the  United Nations Security  Council , adopted  on 22 May  2003, \\nwhich called on the  Authority  “to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective \\nadministration of the territory, including in particular working towards the restoration of conditions \\nof security and stability  ...”. The occupation ended on 28 June 2004 with the dissolution of the \\nCoalition Provisional Authority and the transfer of authority to the interim Iraqi government. During \\nthe period  of occupation, the United Kingdom  had been in command of the Multinational Division \\n(South -East) (Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  2011, §§ 9-23). \\n99.  The case of  Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2011,  concerned the deaths of  six \\nof the applicants ’ relatives in  Basra in 2003, when the  United Kingdom  had held  occupying  power \\nstatus there . Three of them had been killed or fatally wounded by gunfire from British soldiers ; \\nanother victim  had been fatally injured during an exchange of fire between  a British patrol  and \\nunidentified  gunmen ; another had been shot by British soldiers  and then forced to j ump into a river , \\nwhere he had drowned ; and 93 wounds had been found on the body of the last  victim , who had died \\nin a British  military  base . The Court  noted that following the removal from power of the Ba ’ath \\nregime and until the accession of the interim Iraqi government, the  United Kingdom  (together with \\nthe United States of America) had assumed in Iraq the exercise of some of the public powers \\nnormally to be exercised by a sovereign government.  In particular, the United Kingdom  had assumed \\npower and responsibility for maintaining security in the south -west of the country. In these \\nexceptional circumstances, the re was a  jurisdictional link, for the purposes  of Article 1 of the \\nConvention, between the  United Kingdom  and the persons  killed during  security  operations  \\nconducted by British troops between May  2003 and June  2004 . In the light of that  conclusion, the \\nCourt  considered it unnecessary  to as sess whether the  United Kingdom ’s jurisdiction  was also  \\nestablished  because that State had  exercised  effective  military  control  over South -East Iraq during \\nthat period  (§§ 143-150). That having been said , as the  Court  subsequently pointed out,  the \\nstatement of  facts  in Al-Skein i and Others  had included material which tend ed to demonstrate that \\nthe United Kingdom  was far from being in effective control of the south -eastern area which it \\noccupied, and this had also been the finding of the Court of Appeal, which had heard evidence on \\nthis question in the domestic proceedings  (Hassan  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  2014, § 75, referring  \\nto Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC],  2011, §§ 20-23 and 80). \\n100.  The Court  delivered its judgment  in the case of  Al-Jedda  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2011,  on \\nthe same day as the Al-Skein i and Others  judgment . That case  concerned  the internment  of an  Iraqi  \\ncivilian for over three years (2004 -2007)  in a detention  centre run by the British  forces in Basra . \\nUnlike in Al-Skeini  and Others , the facts  of this case had taken place  after the end of the  occupation  \\nregime , when  power  had already  been transferred  to the  interim  government ; however , the \\nmultinational  force , including British  forces, were still  stationed  in Iraq at the Government ’s request \\nand with the  authorisation  of the United  Nations Security  Council.

It noted that at the time of the invasion  of Iraq, no Security  \\nCouncil  resolution  had specified how the  roles  should be distribu ted in Iraq should the  regime  be \\noverthrown . In May  2003  the United Kingdom  and the United State s, having removed the former \\nregime , had taken  control  of security in Iraq ; the U N had been assigned a  role in the fields of  \\nhumanitarian  aid, supporting the  reconstruction of Iraq and assistance in setting up an Iraqi  \\nprovisional  authority , but not in the  security  sphere . The Court  took the view that the subsequent  \\nresolutions  had not altered  that situation. Since the Security Council had had ne ither effective \\ncontrol nor ultimate authority and control over the acts and omissions of troops within the \\nMultinational Force, the applicant ’s detention was not attributable to the United Nations . The \\ninternment decision against  the applicant had been ta ken by the British officer in command of the \\ndetention facility, and he had been interned  in a detention facility in Basra City, controlled \\nexclusively by British forces . Although the decision to keep  the applicant in internment had, at \\nvarious points, been reviewed by committees including Iraqi officials and non -The United Kingdom  \\nrepresentatives from the Multinational Force, the existence of these reviews had not operated to \\nprevent the detention from being attributable to the  United Kingdom . Mr Al -Jedda had therefore \\nbeen under the authority  and control  of the  United Kingdom  for the duration of his detention. In \\nconclusion, the Court found  that the internment of the applicant had been  attributable to the  United \\nKingdom  and that during his inte rnment the applicant had fallen  within the jurisdiction of the  United \\nKingdom  for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention  (§§ 76-86). The Court  had thus  \\nconcentr ated on whether the applic ant had been  effective ly subject to the power of the respondent \\nState rather than assessing  the extent and  nature of the  controlee  exerc ised by the  United Kingdom  \\nover the territory  in question.  \\n101.  The sa me approach  had been adopted in the case of  Hassan  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2014, \\nconcerning  the capture of the applic ant’s brother by the  British armed forces and his  detention  in \\nCamp Bucca  in south -eastern  Iraq during the  hostilities  in 2003.  The applic ant submitted that his \\nbrother had been under the control of the British  forces and that his corpse, when subsequently \\nfound, had borne traces suggesting  that he had been tortured  and executed . As in  the Al-Skeini and \\nOthers  judgment , the Court  did not deem it  necessary to determine whether the  United Kingdom  \\nhad indeed been in  control of the area in  question during the relevant  period  because the  direct  \\nvictim had fallen under that country ’s jurisdiction  for another reason . In that connection the Court \\nrejected the Government ’s argument to the effect that no jurisdiction had applied because as \\nregards the period subsequent to his admission to Camp Bucca, the applicant ’s brother had been \\ntransferred from the authority of the  United Kingdom  to that of the United States. Having regard  to \\nthe arrangements operating at Camp Bucca, the Court  held that the  United Kingdom  had retained \\nauthority and control over the direct  victim . That authority and that control had extended from the \\nadmission of the applicant ’s brother to the Camp through the period following his admission, when \\nhe had been taken to the Joint Forward Interrogation Team compound, which was under the \\nexclusive control of the British forces. Following the  interrogation  the British  authorities  had placed \\nhim on one of the categories  set out in  international humanitarian  law, deciding that he was a \\n“civilian” who did not pose a threat to security , and ordered that he should be released as soon as \\npracticable . Finally, it was  clear  that when he had been taken to the civilian holding area with a view \\nto his release, the applicant ’s brother had remained in the custody of armed military personnel and \\nunder the authority and control of the  United Kingdom  until the moment he was let off the bus that \\ntook him from the Camp . He had therefore been within the jurisdiction of the  United Kingdom  \\nthroughout the period  in question (§§ 75-80).

In the case of  Jaloud  v. the Netherlands  [GC] , 2014, the Court  broadened the  concept of \\nextraterritorial  jurisdiction as compared with  Al-Skeini and Others  and Al-Jedda , explicitly stating that \\nthe “occup ying power” status mentioned in A rticle  42 of the Hague Convention respecting the Laws \\nand Customs of War on Land was not in itself decisive vis-à-vis the question of jurisdiction  for the \\npurposes of A rticle  1 of the  Convention  (§ 142). Following the  Iraq invasion , the Netherlands \\nGovernment  had provided troops  which had been  based in south -east Iraq between July 2003 and \\nMarch 2005 , as part of a  multinational  division under the  command  of an  officer  of the British  armed  \\nforces . In the instant  case the applic ant’s son had been fatally wounded by gunfire in April  2004, \\nwhen he had been attempting  to pass a checkpoint  which was  controlled  by the Iraqi Civil Defence  \\nCorps ( ICDC)  but which also involved  members  of the Netherlands Royal Army  operating under the \\ncommand  and direct  supervision of a  Royal Army  officer ; the shots had been fired by a Dutch  \\nlieutenant . The Court  noted that the Netherlands had not forfeited  jurisdiction  by the mere  fact of  \\naccept ing the  operational  control  of a British  officer . As the evidence on  file demonstrated, not only \\nhad the Netherlands retained full  command  of their  military  personnel in Iraq, but also the \\nestablishment of separate rules on the use of force in Iraq remained the reserved domain of \\nindividual sending States . The Court therefore concluded, in the circumstances of the case, that the \\nNetherlands forces had not been placed at the disposal of any other State, be it Iraq or the  United \\nKingdom , and that the death of the applicant ’s brother had occurred under  the jurisdiction of the \\nNetherlands  (§ 142).  \\n103.  However , the Court  reached the  opposite conclusion  in the case of Issa and Others  v. Turkey , \\n2004, which concerned Iraqi  Kurdish shepherds who had allegedly been  arrested by Turkish  soldiers  \\nduring a Turkish military  operation in northern  Iraq i n 1995, and then  been  taken to a  cave  and \\nkilled . In the  Court ’s view , notwithstanding the large  number  of soldiers  involved in that  operation , it \\ndid not appear that Turkey had exercised effec tive overall control of the entire area in question. \\nMoreover , it had not been  sufficiently  established  by the evidence on file that the Turkish  armed \\nforces had been conducting  operations  in the  geographical  area in question when the victims  had \\nbeen pres ent there . Consequently , the direct victims  could not be  considered  to have been within the  \\njurisdiction  of the  Turkish State  (§§ 71-82). \\n104.  In an inter -State case against Russia , the Ukrainian Government had raised a series of \\ncomplaints concerning events which had occurred between 27 February 2014 and 26 August 2015 , \\nin the course of which  the Crimea n region (including the city of Sebastopol) had been incorporated \\ninto the Russia n Federation . The Court  examined  the question  of the respondent State ’s \\n“jurisdiction”, dealing separately with two different periods: the period preceding 18 March 2014, \\nwhen the Russian F ederation, the “ Crimea n Republic” and the City of Sebastopol had si gned a \\n“unification treaty” incorporating Crimea  into Russia, and the period since that date. As regards the \\nformer period, the Court followed its usual approach as defined in Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United \\nKingdom  [GC] , 2011  (§§ 133-140), exceptionally recognising the extraterritorial exercise of \\njurisdiction based on the “effective control” by Russia of the area in q uestion . The Court  based it \\nfinding on a detailed  appraisal of the evidence  relating to the  circumstances  of the  case, assessing  \\nboth the power and the actual conduct of the Russian military  forces in Crimea . Regarding the \\nformer aspect Sur le premier poin t (military power ), the Court  considered  that the  question whether \\nthe reinforcement  of the Russian  military  presence  in Crimea  at the time had been in compliance \\nwith the bilateral  agreements in force between the two S tates could not be decisive : it attac hed \\ngreater importance to the relative  size and strength of the respondent S tate’s armed  forces in the \\narea in question than to their combat potential , also focusing on the reasons given for increasing the \\nmilitary presence . In connection with the  second aspect  (the army ’s actual behaviour ), the Court  had \\nregard to the level of the Russian soldiers ’ active involvement in the  impugned events  in Crimea , as \\nwell as the  public  statements made by various high officials in the respondent S tate. Having regard  \\nto all the available evidence, the Court  conclu ded that  Russia  had exercised  effective  control  over  \\nCrimea  during the period in question .

The Court  noted that the Netherlands had not forfeited  jurisdiction  by the mere  fact of  \\naccept ing the  operational  control  of a British  officer . As the evidence on  file demonstrated, not only \\nhad the Netherlands retained full  command  of their  military  personnel in Iraq, but also the \\nestablishment of separate rules on the use of force in Iraq remained the reserved domain of \\nindividual sending States . The Court therefore concluded, in the circumstances of the case, that the \\nNetherlands forces had not been placed at the disposal of any other State, be it Iraq or the  United \\nKingdom , and that the death of the applicant ’s brother had occurred under  the jurisdiction of the \\nNetherlands  (§ 142).  \\n103.  However , the Court  reached the  opposite conclusion  in the case of Issa and Others  v. Turkey , \\n2004, which concerned Iraqi  Kurdish shepherds who had allegedly been  arrested by Turkish  soldiers  \\nduring a Turkish military  operation in northern  Iraq i n 1995, and then  been  taken to a  cave  and \\nkilled . In the  Court ’s view , notwithstanding the large  number  of soldiers  involved in that  operation , it \\ndid not appear that Turkey had exercised effec tive overall control of the entire area in question. \\nMoreover , it had not been  sufficiently  established  by the evidence on file that the Turkish  armed \\nforces had been conducting  operations  in the  geographical  area in question when the victims  had \\nbeen pres ent there . Consequently , the direct victims  could not be  considered  to have been within the  \\njurisdiction  of the  Turkish State  (§§ 71-82). \\n104.  In an inter -State case against Russia , the Ukrainian Government had raised a series of \\ncomplaints concerning events which had occurred between 27 February 2014 and 26 August 2015 , \\nin the course of which  the Crimea n region (including the city of Sebastopol) had been incorporated \\ninto the Russia n Federation . The Court  examined  the question  of the respondent State ’s \\n“jurisdiction”, dealing separately with two different periods: the period preceding 18 March 2014, \\nwhen the Russian F ederation, the “ Crimea n Republic” and the City of Sebastopol had si gned a \\n“unification treaty” incorporating Crimea  into Russia, and the period since that date. As regards the \\nformer period, the Court followed its usual approach as defined in Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United \\nKingdom  [GC] , 2011  (§§ 133-140), exceptionally recognising the extraterritorial exercise of \\njurisdiction based on the “effective control” by Russia of the area in q uestion . The Court  based it \\nfinding on a detailed  appraisal of the evidence  relating to the  circumstances  of the  case, assessing  \\nboth the power and the actual conduct of the Russian military  forces in Crimea . Regarding the \\nformer aspect Sur le premier poin t (military power ), the Court  considered  that the  question whether \\nthe reinforcement  of the Russian  military  presence  in Crimea  at the time had been in compliance \\nwith the bilateral  agreements in force between the two S tates could not be decisive : it attac hed \\ngreater importance to the relative  size and strength of the respondent S tate’s armed  forces in the \\narea in question than to their combat potential , also focusing on the reasons given for increasing the \\nmilitary presence . In connection with the  second aspect  (the army ’s actual behaviour ), the Court  had \\nregard to the level of the Russian soldiers ’ active involvement in the  impugned events  in Crimea , as \\nwell as the  public  statements made by various high officials in the respondent S tate. Having regard  \\nto all the available evidence, the Court  conclu ded that  Russia  had exercised  effective  control  over  \\nCrimea  during the period in question . That being the case, it was unnecessary  to determine  whethe r \\nthe respondent S tate had  exercised  specific  control  over the  policies and  actions of the  local  '}, {'number': 105, 'start': 886, 'page_num': 33, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  34/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 authorities . The fact that Ukraine had not avail ed itself of the right of derogation from its Convention \\nobligatio ns in respect of Crimea  regarding the period in question is irrelevant for the above findings \\nconcerning the respondent State ’s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention . In short , the \\nalleged victims of the  administrative practice complained of by th e Ukrainian  Government  had fallen  \\nunder the  “jurisdiction”  of the Russian  State during the  period  in question , without any need to \\nascertain whether such jurisdiction  had also been based on th e principle  of “State  agent authority”  \\n(Ukraine  v. Russia (re Crimea ) (dec.) [GC] , 2020, §§ 308-352).  \\n105.  A different inter -State application against Russia  concern ed complaints related to the confl ict, \\ninvolving pro -Russian separatists , which had broken out in eastern Ukraine in the same period as in \\nthe previously mentioned case . One of the applicant Governments , that of Ukraine, had complained \\nmainly about the ongoing patterns  (“administrative  practices” ) of violations of a number of  \\nConvention Articles which had allegedly been committed by separatists of the “Donetsk People ’s \\nRepublic” (DPR)  and “Lugansk People ’s Republic”  (LPR) and by Russian army personnel . The other \\napplicant Government, that of the Netherlands , had complained about the  downing  of the Malaysia \\nAirlines aircraft  operating flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014, killing  298 including  196 \\nDutch nationals . The applicant Governments had argued that their c omplaints fell within the \\njurisdiction of the Russian Federation . The Court concluded, in particular, that at least from 11 May  \\n2014 to 26 January  2022, the areas in eastern Ukraine  that were  under separatist  control  fell within \\nthe jurisdiction of the Rus sian Federation . It noted the presence of Russian military personnel in \\neastern Ukrain e, from Ap ril 2014 onwards, and the mass deployment of Russian troops from August  \\n2014 a t the latest . It also noted the decisive degree of influence and control Russia en joyed over the \\nseparatist military strategy ; that from the earliest days of the DPR and LPR  administrations and over \\nthe ensuing months and years the Russian Federation had provided weapons and other military \\nequipment to the separatists in eastern Ukraine  on a significant scale; and that the separatists had \\nrelied on the Russian military for artillery cover and that political and economic support had been \\nprovided to them by Russia. In those circumstances the Court arrived at the conclusion that there \\nwas sufficient evidence to satisfy the  “beyond reasonable doubt ” standard required at the \\nadmissibility stage  in respect of  administrative practices  alleged to breach certain Convention  \\nArticles . It declared admissible the majority of the complaints submitted by the Ukrainian \\nGovernment as the territory in question did fall  within the respondent State ’s Article 1 “jurisdiction” . \\nIt also decided that the same evidence test was met in respect of the complaints of the Netherlands  \\nGovernment  about flight  MH17 ( Ukraine and the Netherlands  v. Russia  [GC] (d ec.), 2022, § § 576-\\n706).  \\nii.  Creation of a n entity unrecognised by the international community  \\n106.

The Court acknowledged that the alleged violations in the North of Cyprus fell within Turkey ’s \\njurisdiction  in the following cases:  \\n▪ In two initial inter -State cases  examined in its decision of Cyprus  v. Turkey , the Commission \\nheld that the Turkish armed forces in Cyprus we re representatives of Turkey, which meant \\nthat all the military property and personnel  present in Cyprus fell within the jurisdiction of \\nthat State , insofar as that military personnel exercised their  authority  over such persons  \\nand property . \\n▪ In the case of  Loizidou  v. Turkey  (preliminary  objections ), 1995, where the applicant , a \\nGreek Cypriot , complained  that she had been deprived  of access  to her property  in \\nnorthern  Cyprus , the Court  noted, at the  preliminary  objections  stage , that the applicant ’s \\nloss of control of her property stemmed  from the occupation of the northern part of \\nCyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment there of the \"TRNC\", and that the applicant \\nhad been prevent ed by Turkish troops from gaining access to her property . The impugned  \\nacts were therefore capable of falling within Turkish \"jurisdiction\" within the meaning of \\nArticle 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 63-64). In the judgment on the merit s of the same \\ncase, the Court, considering the “imputability” of the alleged violations to Turkey, held that \\nit was unnecessary to determine whether that country actually exercised detailed control \\nover the policies a nd actions of the authorities of the \"TRNC\", because  it was obvious from \\nthe large number of troops engaged in active duties in the disputed area that the Turkish \\narmy exercised effective overall control over that part of the island ; such  control incurr ed \\nTurkish responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC\" . Persons  affected by th ose \\npolicies and  actions therefore fell within  the “jurisdiction ” of Turkey, and the alleged  \\nviolations were consequently  “imputable ” to that S tate (Loizidou  v. Turkey  (merits ), 1996, \\n§§ 52-57). \\n▪ In the inter -State case of Cyprus  v. Turkey  [GC], 2001, the Court reiterated its general \\nfinding in Loizidou  that Turkey in practice exercised overall control in norther n Cyprus via \\nits military presence on the ground; consequently, its responsibility  under the  Convention \\nwas incurred for the policies and actions of the “TRNC” authorities . The Court  emphasised \\nthat Turkey ’s responsibility  under the  Convention could not be  confined to the acts of its \\nown soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but had also to be engaged by virtue of the acts \\nof the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support . \\nTurkey ’s “jurisdiction” should be conside red to extend to securing the entire range of \\nsubstantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which Turkey \\nhas ratified, and violations of those rights were  imputable to it (§§ 76-77).

Turkey  (preliminary  objections ), 1995, where the applicant , a \\nGreek Cypriot , complained  that she had been deprived  of access  to her property  in \\nnorthern  Cyprus , the Court  noted, at the  preliminary  objections  stage , that the applicant ’s \\nloss of control of her property stemmed  from the occupation of the northern part of \\nCyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment there of the \"TRNC\", and that the applicant \\nhad been prevent ed by Turkish troops from gaining access to her property . The impugned  \\nacts were therefore capable of falling within Turkish \"jurisdiction\" within the meaning of \\nArticle 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 63-64). In the judgment on the merit s of the same \\ncase, the Court, considering the “imputability” of the alleged violations to Turkey, held that \\nit was unnecessary to determine whether that country actually exercised detailed control \\nover the policies a nd actions of the authorities of the \"TRNC\", because  it was obvious from \\nthe large number of troops engaged in active duties in the disputed area that the Turkish \\narmy exercised effective overall control over that part of the island ; such  control incurr ed \\nTurkish responsibility for the policies and actions of the \"TRNC\" . Persons  affected by th ose \\npolicies and  actions therefore fell within  the “jurisdiction ” of Turkey, and the alleged  \\nviolations were consequently  “imputable ” to that S tate (Loizidou  v. Turkey  (merits ), 1996, \\n§§ 52-57). \\n▪ In the inter -State case of Cyprus  v. Turkey  [GC], 2001, the Court reiterated its general \\nfinding in Loizidou  that Turkey in practice exercised overall control in norther n Cyprus via \\nits military presence on the ground; consequently, its responsibility  under the  Convention \\nwas incurred for the policies and actions of the “TRNC” authorities . The Court  emphasised \\nthat Turkey ’s responsibility  under the  Convention could not be  confined to the acts of its \\nown soldiers or officials in northern Cyprus but had also to be engaged by virtue of the acts \\nof the local administration which survives by virtue of Turkish military and other support . \\nTurkey ’s “jurisdiction” should be conside red to extend to securing the entire range of \\nsubstantive rights set out in the Convention and those additional Protocols which Turkey \\nhas ratified, and violations of those rights were  imputable to it (§§ 76-77).

Northern  Cyprus was under the \\neffective control of Turkey for the purposes of the Convention . Secondly, the murder \\nsuspects had fled to the “TRNC” and as a consequence, the Republic of Cyprus had been \\nprevented from pursuing its own cr iminal investigation in respect of those suspects and \\nthus from fulfilling its Convention obligations (§ 193).  \\n111.  The second  series  of cases  concerns  the responsibility  of Russia  for acts committed  in the  \\n“Moldovan  Republic  of Trans dniestria ”, an entity  set up in  Moldavan  territory . In the case o f Ilaşcu \\nand Others  v. Moldova and Russia  [GC] , 2004, the applic ants, who had been sentenced variously to \\ndeath and heavy prison sentences by the  “supreme  court ” of that  entity , complained of a  series  of \\nviolations of their fundamental  rights  which they alleged  were  imputable  to Russia . The Court  noted \\nthat in  1991 -1992, forces of the former  14th Arm y (which had belonged successive ly to the  USSR and  \\nRussi a), station ed in Trans dniestria, had fought w ith and for the Transdniestrian  separatist forces . \\nLarge quantitie s of weapons from the  14th Arm y’s arsenal had been  transf erred voluntarily  to the \\nseparatist s, who had, moreover, been able to secure further arms , unoppose d by the Russian \\nmilitary . Furthermore , throughout the con front ations between the Moldovan  authorities  and the  \\nTrans dniestrian separatists , the Russian lead ers had issue political statements in support  of the \\nseparatist  authorities . Even after the ceasefire agreement, Russia  had continued to provide military, \\npolitical and economic support to the separatist regime, thus enabling i t to survive by strengthening \\nitself and by acquiring a certain amount of autonomy vis-à-vis Moldova . In the Court ’s view, all the \\nacts committed against the applicants by the Russian military authorities, including their handover to \\nthe separatist regime,  in the context of collaboration between the Russian authorities and that \\nunlawful regime, which was not recognised by the international community, had been such as to \\ncreate responsibility for the consequences of the acts of that regime. The whole case -file proved  that \\nthe Transdniestrian  region  remained under Russia ’s effective  authority , or at least under its  decisive  \\ninfluence , and at any event that it survived  thanks to the military , economic , financial  and political  \\nsupport provided by Russia both before and after its  ratifi cation of the Convention . In those  \\ncircumstances , the applic ants were within the  “jurisdiction ” of Russia , whose  responsibility  was \\nincurred in relation to the impugned  acts (§§ 377-394). \\n112.  This conclusion as regards Russia ’s responsibility  vis-à-vis Trans dniestria was  reiterated in the \\nfollowing cases : \\n▪ In the case of Ivanţoc and Others  v.

Moldova and Russia  [GC] , \\n2004,  after and despite the delivery of the  Grand Chamber  judgment in this case. The  Court  \\nsought to establish whether Russia ’s policy of supporting the  Trans dniestrian separatist  \\nregime  had changed between  2004 and 2007, the date of the applic ants ’ release . It noted \\nthat Russia  continued to enjoy a close relationship with the “Moldovan Republic  of \\nTransdniestria”, amounting to providing political, financial and economic support to the \\nseparatist regime . Moreover , the Court  found that the  Russian army (troops, equipment \\nand ammunition) had, at the date of the applicants ’ release, still been stati oned on \\nMoldovan territory in breach of the Russian Federation ’s undertakings to withdraw \\ncompletely and in breach of Moldovan legislation . The applic ants had therefore fallen  \\nwithin Russia ’s “jurisdiction”  for the purposes  of A rticle  1 of the  Convention ( Ivanţoc and \\nOthers  v.

In its observations, the Russian Government  had \\nacknowledged a substantial Russian  military presence  after the cessation of hostilities  and provided \\nnumerous indications showing the extent of the economic and financial support that the Russian \\nFederation had provided and continued to provide to South Ossetia and to Abkhazia . the EU ’s Fact -\\nFinding Mission also emphasised  the rel ationship of dependency not only in economic and financial, \\nbut also in military and political terms ; the information provided was also revealing as to the pre -\\nexisting relationship  of subordination between the separatist entities and the Russian Federatio n, \\nwhich had lasted throughout the active phase of the hostilities and after the cessation of hostilities . \\nIn its  report , the EU ’s Fact -Finding Mission  had spoken of “creeping  annex ation” of South Ossetia  \\nand Abkhazia  by Russia . The Court  considered that the  Russian  Federation  had exercised  effective  \\ncontrol  over South  Ossetia  and Abkhazia  (as well as a  “buffer  zone ” located in undisputed  Georgian  \\nterritory ) during the  period  from the  date of cessation of active hostilities  and the date of the official  \\nwithdrawal of  Russian  troops . Even after that  period , the strong Russian presence and the South \\nOssetian and Abkhazian authorities ’ dependency on the Russian Federation, on whom their survival \\ndepended , as was shown particularly by the cooperation and assistance agreements signed with the \\nlatter, indicate d that there had been  continued “effective control” over the two territories .

As regards the  large number of Georgian nationals who had fled the conflict and been unable \\nto return to South Ossetia , they had also com e under  Russia ’s jurisdiction .

In its assessment the Court relied on a long series of factual circumstances; for example, \\nthe fact that the peace -keeping forces in Abkhazia  were made up of Russian military personnel ; that \\nthe majority of the  population of Abkhazi a had been given Russian natio nality after  2002; that \\nAbkhazi a used Russian currency as  its means of payment and was economically heavily dependent \\non Russia ; lastly, according to the repeated statements of its (de facto  Abkhaz)  leaders , Abkhazi a had \\nin some ways become part of Russia .

Georgia and Russia , 2023, § § 323-340). \\n116.  Finally, t he fourt h situation examined  by the  Court  concerne d the  responsibility  of Armenia  for \\nacts committed  in the  “Republic  of Nagorno -Karabakh”  established  in an area  of Azerbaijan . At the \\ntime of the dissolution of the Soviet  Union in December  1991, the Nagorno -Karabakh Autonomous  \\nOblast (the “ NKA O”) had been an  autonomous  province situated within the  Azerbaijan  Soviet \\nSocialist  Republic  (“the Azerbaijan  SSR”). There had been no common border between the NKAO and \\nthe Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (“the Armenian SSR”), which had been separated by \\nAzerbaijani territory . In 1988 armed  hostilities broke out in this  region . In September  1991 – shortly \\nafter  Azerbaijan  had proclaimed  its indepen dence  from the Soviet  Union  – the NKAO  soviet  \\nannounced  the foundation of the “Nagorno -Karabakh Republic ” (“the  NKR”), compr ising the NKAO \\nand the Shahumyan district of  Azerbaijan . Following a  referendum  held i n December  1991 (and \\nboycotted  by the Azeri  population)  in which  99.9 % of voters had come down in favour  of the  \\nsecession  of the “NKR”, the latter  reaffirmed  its independence  from Azerbaijan  in January  1992. \\nAfter that the  conflict  gradually escalated into full -scale war . By the end of  1993  the ethnic Armenian  \\ntroops  had gained control  over almost  the entire  territory  of the former NKAO and seven  adjacent \\nAzerbaijani  regions . In May  1994  the belligerent s signed  a ceasefire agreement, which is still in force . \\nThe self -proclaimed independ ence  of the  “NKR” has not been  recognised by any S tate or  \\ninternational  organisation (Chiragov and Others  v. Armenia  [GC],  2015, §§ 12-31; Sargsyan  \\nv. Azerbaijan  [GC] , 2015, §§ 14-28). \\n117.  In the case of  Chiragov and Others  v. Armenia  [GC] , 2015, the applic ants, Azerbaijani  Kurds  \\nfrom the Lachin district (which is part of Azerbaijan , separating  Nagorno -Karabakh from  Armenia ), \\ncomplained  of their inability to accede  to their homes and property since having  been forced to \\nleave the district by the armed  conflict  between the two countries . Under A rticle  1 of the  \\nConvention, the Court  had regard to a whole  series of reports and publi c statements  – particular ly \\nfrom present and former memb ers of the Armenia n Government – and conclud ed that  Arme nia, \\nthrough its milita ry presence and its prov ision of  military  materia l and advice , had been involved in \\nthe Nagorno -Karabakh  confli ct from the very early stage s. In the  Court ’s view , that military support \\nwas decisive for the control over the territories in issue , and moreover, it was obvious from the  facts  \\nof the  case that Armenia  provided substantial politi cal and financial  support  to the “NKR ” (“Nagorno -\\nKarabakh Republic”) . Furthermore , the residents  of the  “NKR” were required to obtain  Armenian  \\npassports to travel abroad . The Court found that Armenia and the “NKR ” had been highly integrated \\nin virtually all important matters, and that the NKR and its administration survived thanks to the \\nmilitary, political, financial and other supported provided by Armenia, which, accordingly, exercised \\neffective control over Nago rno-Karabakh and the adjacent territories. The alleged facts  had \\ntherefore occurred within the  jurisdiction  of Armenia  (§§ 169-186). \\n118.  The Court  reached the same  conclusion concerning  Armenian  jurisdiction  in the following \\ncase s: '}, {'number': 117, 'start': 3395, 'page_num': 37, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  38/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 115.

Following a  referendum  held i n December  1991 (and \\nboycotted  by the Azeri  population)  in which  99.9 % of voters had come down in favour  of the  \\nsecession  of the “NKR”, the latter  reaffirmed  its independence  from Azerbaijan  in January  1992. \\nAfter that the  conflict  gradually escalated into full -scale war . By the end of  1993  the ethnic Armenian  \\ntroops  had gained control  over almost  the entire  territory  of the former NKAO and seven  adjacent \\nAzerbaijani  regions . In May  1994  the belligerent s signed  a ceasefire agreement, which is still in force . \\nThe self -proclaimed independ ence  of the  “NKR” has not been  recognised by any S tate or  \\ninternational  organisation (Chiragov and Others  v.

Under A rticle  1 of the  \\nConvention, the Court  had regard to a whole  series of reports and publi c statements  – particular ly \\nfrom present and former memb ers of the Armenia n Government – and conclud ed that  Arme nia, \\nthrough its milita ry presence and its prov ision of  military  materia l and advice , had been involved in \\nthe Nagorno -Karabakh  confli ct from the very early stage s.

Furthermore , the residents  of the  “NKR” were required to obtain  Armenian  \\npassports to travel abroad .

Concerning Abkhazia , the Court has also recognised the existence of “effective control” by \\nRussia over its territory  for a period preceding the armed conflict of  2008. It found in the relevant \\ncase that since the  armed conflict between Georgians and Abkhazians in 1992, Russi a had not \\nceased to extend and strengthen its  influence over this re gion militarily , politi cally , economically and \\nculturally . In its assessment the Court relied on a long series of factual circumstances; for example, \\nthe fact that the peace -keeping forces in Abkhazia  were made up of Russian military personnel ; that \\nthe majority of the  population of Abkhazi a had been given Russian natio nality after  2002; that \\nAbkhazi a used Russian currency as  its means of payment and was economically heavily dependent \\non Russia ; lastly, according to the repeated statements of its (de facto  Abkhaz)  leaders , Abkhazi a had \\nin some ways become part of Russia . In sum , Abkhazia was only able to survive because of Russia ’s \\nsustained and substantial political and economic support, and of Russia ’s military influence,  which \\nwas sufficient for it to be considered “dissuasive” and as such decisive in practice . It foll owed that \\nthe conduct of the de facto  authorities of that region  fell within Russia ’s jurisdiction under Article 1 \\nof the Convention ( Mamasakhlisi and Others  v. Georgia and Russia , 2023, § § 323-340). \\n116.  Finally, t he fourt h situation examined  by the  Court  concerne d the  responsibility  of Armenia  for \\nacts committed  in the  “Republic  of Nagorno -Karabakh”  established  in an area  of Azerbaijan . At the \\ntime of the dissolution of the Soviet  Union in December  1991, the Nagorno -Karabakh Autonomous  \\nOblast (the “ NKA O”) had been an  autonomous  province situated within the  Azerbaijan  Soviet \\nSocialist  Republic  (“the Azerbaijan  SSR”). There had been no common border between the NKAO and \\nthe Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (“the Armenian SSR”), which had been separated by \\nAzerbaijani territory . In 1988 armed  hostilities broke out in this  region . In September  1991 – shortly \\nafter  Azerbaijan  had proclaimed  its indepen dence  from the Soviet  Union  – the NKAO  soviet  \\nannounced  the foundation of the “Nagorno -Karabakh Republic ” (“the  NKR”), compr ising the NKAO \\nand the Shahumyan district of  Azerbaijan .

Even if the  municipal  authority  which had  ordered the cutting off of the water, \\nheating and electricity  supplies had operated under the  control  of that  entity , unlike in the other \\ncases, the Moldavan  authorities  had exercised  effective  control  over the  prison in which the alleged  \\nviolations had occur red, as well as over its inmates. The latter authorities could therefore have \\nintervened  direct ly (§ 46). \\n122.  In the  case of  Sargsyan  v. Azerbaijan  [GC] , 2015, an Armenian  refugee  who had had to flee his \\nhome in the Shahumyan region  of Azerbaijan  in 1992 , during th e conflict  between  Armenia  and \\nAzerbaijan  over Nagorno -Karabakh ( see above ), complained  that he had been unable to  return  to his  \\nvillage  in order to  acce ss and use his property there . This was the first case  in which the Court  was \\ncalled upon to determine a complaint against a State which had lost control of  part of its  territory  as \\na result of a war and  occupation, but which was  alleged  to have been  responsible  for refus ing to \\nallow a  displaced  person to  accede to his property situated in a  regio n which was still under its  \\ncontrol . The Court  first of all noted that the  village in question was located in the international ly \\nrecognised  territory  of Azerbaijan  and that, accordingly , the presumption of  Azerbaijan ’s jurisdiction \\napplied . It was therefo re incumbent  on the  Azerbaijani  Government to demonstrate the  existence of \\nexceptional  circumstances liable to  limit  its responsibility  under A rticle  1 of the  Convention. Having \\nregard to the fact s before it , the Court  noted that  it was impossible to  determine with any  certainty \\nwhether the  Azerbaijani  military forces had been  present in the  village during its  period  of \\ntempor ary jurisdiction (that is to say since the  ratification of the  Convention by Azerbaijan ). \\nMoreover , it observed th at no party  had alleged  that the  “Republic  of Nagorno -Karabakh ” had had \\nany troops  in the  village. The Court was not  convinced  by the Government ’s argument to the effect \\nthat because  the village had been located in a disputed are and was surrounded by mine s and \\nmilitary  positions , Azerbaijan ’s responsibility under the  Convention had been  limited . Indeed , unlike \\nin other similar cas es concerning  Trans dniestria or Northern Cyprus , the territory  in question had not \\nbeen  occupied by the  armed forces of a third S tate. The facts of the  case  had therefore fallen within \\nthe jurisdiction  of Azerbaijan  (§§ 132-151). \\n123.  The case of Assanidze  v. Georgia  [GC] , 2004,  concerned an unusual  situation.  The applic ant \\ncomplained that he had been retained in  the custody of the  auth orities  of the Ajarian Autonomous  \\nRepublic , an autonomous  territorial  unit of Georgia , despite  having received a presidential pardon \\nfor a first offence and been  acquitted of a second by the Supreme Court of Georgia . The Court  noted \\nthat Georgia  had ratified  the Convention for the whole of its territory,  and that no other State \\nexercised  effective overall control in Ajaria . On ratifying the Convention, Georgia did not make any \\nspecific reservation under Article 57 of the Convention with regard to Ajar ia or to difficulties in \\nexercising its jurisdiction over that territory. Such a reservation would in any event have been \\nineffective, as the case -law precludes territorial exclusions other than in the instance referred to in \\nArticle 56 § 1 of the Con venti on (dependent territories) . Therefore , the impugned  facts  had fallen \\nwithin the  “jurisdiction ” of Georgia  for the purposes of A rticle  1 of the  Convention ( §§ 139-143). The \\nCourt  then considered the “imputability”  to the Georgian State of the  alleged  violat ions. It noted  \\nthat the central  authorities  had taken all the procedural steps possible under domestic law to secure \\ncompliance with the judgment acquitting the applicant, sought to resolve the dispute by various \\npolitical means, and repeatedly urged the Ajarian authorities to release him, all in vain .

The latter authorities could therefore have \\nintervened  direct ly (§ 46). \\n122.  In the  case of  Sargsyan  v. Azerbaijan  [GC] , 2015, an Armenian  refugee  who had had to flee his \\nhome in the Shahumyan region  of Azerbaijan  in 1992 , during th e conflict  between  Armenia  and \\nAzerbaijan  over Nagorno -Karabakh ( see above ), complained  that he had been unable to  return  to his  \\nvillage  in order to  acce ss and use his property there . This was the first case  in which the Court  was \\ncalled upon to determine a complaint against a State which had lost control of  part of its  territory  as \\na result of a war and  occupation, but which was  alleged  to have been  responsible  for refus ing to \\nallow a  displaced  person to  accede to his property situated in a  regio n which was still under its  \\ncontrol . The Court  first of all noted that the  village in question was located in the international ly \\nrecognised  territory  of Azerbaijan  and that, accordingly , the presumption of  Azerbaijan ’s jurisdiction \\napplied . It was therefo re incumbent  on the  Azerbaijani  Government to demonstrate the  existence of \\nexceptional  circumstances liable to  limit  its responsibility  under A rticle  1 of the  Convention. Having \\nregard to the fact s before it , the Court  noted that  it was impossible to  determine with any  certainty \\nwhether the  Azerbaijani  military forces had been  present in the  village during its  period  of \\ntempor ary jurisdiction (that is to say since the  ratification of the  Convention by Azerbaijan ). \\nMoreover , it observed th at no party  had alleged  that the  “Republic  of Nagorno -Karabakh ” had had \\nany troops  in the  village. The Court was not  convinced  by the Government ’s argument to the effect \\nthat because  the village had been located in a disputed are and was surrounded by mine s and \\nmilitary  positions , Azerbaijan ’s responsibility under the  Convention had been  limited . Indeed , unlike \\nin other similar cas es concerning  Trans dniestria or Northern Cyprus , the territory  in question had not \\nbeen  occupied by the  armed forces of a third S tate. The facts of the  case  had therefore fallen within \\nthe jurisdiction  of Azerbaijan  (§§ 132-151). \\n123.  The case of Assanidze  v. Georgia  [GC] , 2004,  concerned an unusual  situation.  The applic ant \\ncomplained that he had been retained in  the custody of the  auth orities  of the Ajarian Autonomous  \\nRepublic , an autonomous  territorial  unit of Georgia , despite  having received a presidential pardon \\nfor a first offence and been  acquitted of a second by the Supreme Court of Georgia . The Court  noted \\nthat Georgia  had ratified  the Convention for the whole of its territory,  and that no other State \\nexercised  effective overall control in Ajaria . On ratifying the Convention, Georgia did not make any \\nspecific reservation under Article 57 of the Convention with regard to Ajar ia or to difficulties in \\nexercising its jurisdiction over that territory. Such a reservation would in any event have been \\nineffective, as the case -law precludes territorial exclusions other than in the instance referred to in \\nArticle 56 § 1 of the Con venti on (dependent territories) . Therefore , the impugned  facts  had fallen \\nwithin the  “jurisdiction ” of Georgia  for the purposes of A rticle  1 of the  Convention ( §§ 139-143). The \\nCourt  then considered the “imputability”  to the Georgian State of the  alleged  violat ions. It noted  \\nthat the central  authorities  had taken all the procedural steps possible under domestic law to secure \\ncompliance with the judgment acquitting the applicant, sought to resolve the dispute by various \\npolitical means, and repeatedly urged the Ajarian authorities to release him, all in vain .

However , even though it is not inconceivable that States will encounter \\ndifficulties i n securing compliance with the rights guaranteed by the Convention in all parts of their \\nterritory, each State Party to the Convention nonetheless remains responsible for events occurring \\nanywhere within its national territory . The Court  therefore found th at the responsibility  of the \\nGeorgian  State had been incurred  under the  Convention  (§§ 144-150). \\n124.  When a Contracting State is prevented from exercising authority over its whole territory due to \\nan exceptional fact ual situation, it does not cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article  1 \\nof the Convention over the part of its territory  which is temporarily beyond  its control  (Sargsyan  \\nv. Azerbaijan  [GC],  2015, § 130; Mamasakhlisi and Others  v. Georgia and Russia , 2023, § 317). Such a \\nfactual  situation nonetheless has the  effect  of reducing the scope of that  jurisdiction , in that the \\ncommit ment entered into by the Contracting  State under A rticle  1 must be  examined by the  Court  \\nsolely in the light of the State ’s positive obligations in respect of  persons  present in its territory . The \\nState in question must  endeavour , with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-à-vis \\nforeign States and international organisations, to continue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights \\nand freedoms defined in the  Convention. Although it is not for the Court to indicate which measures \\nthe authorities should take in order to comply with their obligations most effectively, it must verify \\nthat the measures actually taken were appropriate and sufficient in the present case. When fa ced \\nwith a partial or total failure to act, the Court ’s task is to determine to what extent a minimum effort \\nwas nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made. Determining that question is \\nespecially necessary in cases concerning an alleged in fringement of absolute rights such as those \\nguaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (Ilaşcu and Others  v. Moldova and Russia  [GC], \\n2004, §§ 333-334). \\n125.  Generally  speaking, the following six positive obligations  incumbent on the “passive ” State can \\nbe identified  in the Court ’s existing case -law: \\na. Three  general  obligations  \\ni. to affirm  and reaffirm  its sovereignty  over the territory  in issue  (Ilaşcu and \\nOthers  v.

Ireland  [GC] , 2005, concerning  the \\nimplementation in the respondent S tate of an EU Regulation  adopted  on the basis of a UNSC \\nResolution , the Court  created a nuanced  case -law mechanism which may be  summarised  as follows : \\n▪ States a re responsible under the Convention for measures which they adopt pursuant to \\ninternational legal obligations, including where such obligations stem from their \\nmembership of an international organisation to which they have transfe rred part of their \\nsovereignty.  \\n▪ However , a meas ure adopted pursuant to such obligations must be deemed  justified  \\nprovided that the  organisation in question affords  fundamental  rights protection at least  \\nequivalent  – that is to say  comparable – to that provided by the Convention . \\n▪ Nevertheless , such  justification lapses in two situations : \\n\\uf0fa where the impugned  acts do not fall  strict ly within the ambit of the respondent State ’s \\ninternational legal  obligations , in particular where that State has  exercised discretionary  \\npowers ; \\nor else '}, {'number': 130, 'start': 297, 'page_num': 42, 'text': 'Guide on Article 1 of the Convention – Obligation to respect human rights –  \\nConcepts of “jurisdiction” and imputability  \\nEuropean Court of Huma n Rights  43/53 Last update: 31.08 .202 3 \\uf0fa where the protection of the rights in issue , guaranteed  by the  Convention, is manifestly  \\ndeficient . \\n130.  In the case of  M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece  [GC], 2011, the Belgian  Government  invoked the  \\nBosphorus presumption  on the grounds that by sending the applic ant back to  Greece  they were \\nmerely complying with the “Dublin II ” Regulation , to which  the Court  replied that under the so -called \\n“sovereignty  clause ” set out in A rticle  3 § 2 of the  Regulation , that Government  had had the \\ndiscretionary  power  not to  expel the applicant and thus to comply with the Convention. \\nConsequently , the presumption  had not been  appli ed (§§ 339-340). \\nB.  Imputability  to the UN  of alleged  violation s \\n131.  As regards the UN, there are two different hypotheses : \\n1. international military  operations , and \\n2. international sanctions imposed  by the UN Security Council (UNSC) . \\n1.  International  military operations  \\n132.  As regards alleged  violations of human righ ts in the framework of  international military  \\noperations , the Court  has concentrated on identifying  the entity  responsible  for the military  \\noperation  or action in question, that is to say the  entity  which held ultimate  authority  and control . \\n133.  In the case of Behrami and Behrami  v. France and Saramati  v. France, Germany and Norway  \\n(dec.) [GC], 2007, the applicants had been  victims  of airstrikes and de privation of liberty , \\nrespectively, in the framework of  NATO military  operations  in Yugoslav  territory  in 1999. A UNSC \\nResolution had provided for the provision of a security presence (KFOR) by “Member States and \\nrelevant international institutions”, “under UN auspices”, with “substantial NATO  participation” but \\n“under unified  command and  control”. That Resolution  had also provided  for the  deployment , under \\nUN auspices, of an interim  administration for Kosovo (MINUK).  \\n134.  In its  decision , the Court  considered  whether the material  facts  had been  attributable  to the  \\nUN. It noted the  delegation  by the UNS C of its powers under Section  VII of the UN  Charte r, and \\nconcluded that the decisive question was whether the UNS C had retained “ultimate  authority  and \\ncontrol ” over the armed  forces . Appl ying that  criterion , the Court  ruled that the UNS C had indeed \\nretained  “ultim ate authority  and control ”. Having  established  that the acts and  omissions of the  \\nMINUK and KFOR had been  attributable  to the U N, the Court  declared  the applications  incompatible  \\nratione personae  with the  Convention.  \\n135.  The case of  Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2011,  concern ed the deaths of  six \\nIraqis who had been killed or fatally wounded by British troops during the  invasio n of Iraq, where  the \\nUnited Kingdom  had held  occupying power status . The Court  conducted a traditional analysis under \\nArticle  1 of the  Convention in order to  determine whether  the victims  had been within the \\n“jurisdiction ” of the  United Kingdom . It noted that at the material time the  United Kingdom  \\n(together with the United States of America) had assumed in Iraq the exercise of some of the public \\npowers normally to be exercised by a sovereign government . In such  exceptional  circumstances , \\nthere had been a  “jurisdictional  link” between the  United Kingdom  and the persons  killed . As regards \\nthe UNS C, it had merely acknowledged the  role and statu s of the  occupying  powers  in Iraq. \\n136.  In the Al-Jedda  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] (2011) judgment delivered on the  same day as  Al-\\nSkeini  and Others , the Court  adjudicated on an application lodged  by an Iraqi civilian who had been \\ninterned for over three years in a  detention centre run by the British forces in Iraq. The defendant \\nGovernment  submitted that that  internment  had been  imputable to the U N rather than  to the \\nUnited Kingdom . The Court  rejected  that plea .

A UNSC \\nResolution had provided for the provision of a security presence (KFOR) by “Member States and \\nrelevant international institutions”, “under UN auspices”, with “substantial NATO  participation” but \\n“under unified  command and  control”. That Resolution  had also provided  for the  deployment , under \\nUN auspices, of an interim  administration for Kosovo (MINUK).  \\n134.  In its  decision , the Court  considered  whether the material  facts  had been  attributable  to the  \\nUN. It noted the  delegation  by the UNS C of its powers under Section  VII of the UN  Charte r, and \\nconcluded that the decisive question was whether the UNS C had retained “ultimate  authority  and \\ncontrol ” over the armed  forces . Appl ying that  criterion , the Court  ruled that the UNS C had indeed \\nretained  “ultim ate authority  and control ”. Having  established  that the acts and  omissions of the  \\nMINUK and KFOR had been  attributable  to the U N, the Court  declared  the applications  incompatible  \\nratione personae  with the  Convention.  \\n135.  The case of  Al-Skeini and Others  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2011,  concern ed the deaths of  six \\nIraqis who had been killed or fatally wounded by British troops during the  invasio n of Iraq, where  the \\nUnited Kingdom  had held  occupying power status . The Court  conducted a traditional analysis under \\nArticle  1 of the  Convention in order to  determine whether  the victims  had been within the \\n“jurisdiction ” of the  United Kingdom . It noted that at the material time the  United Kingdom  \\n(together with the United States of America) had assumed in Iraq the exercise of some of the public \\npowers normally to be exercised by a sovereign government . In such  exceptional  circumstances , \\nthere had been a  “jurisdictional  link” between the  United Kingdom  and the persons  killed . As regards \\nthe UNS C, it had merely acknowledged the  role and statu s of the  occupying  powers  in Iraq. \\n136.  In the Al-Jedda  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] (2011) judgment delivered on the  same day as  Al-\\nSkeini  and Others , the Court  adjudicated on an application lodged  by an Iraqi civilian who had been \\ninterned for over three years in a  detention centre run by the British forces in Iraq. The defendant \\nGovernment  submitted that that  internment  had been  imputable to the U N rather than  to the \\nUnited Kingdom . The Court  rejected  that plea .

In the case of  M.S.S. v.

As regards the UN, there are two different hypotheses : \\n1. international military  operations , and \\n2. international sanctions imposed  by the UN Security Council (UNSC) . \\n1.  International  military operations  \\n132.  As regards alleged  violations of human righ ts in the framework of  international military  \\noperations , the Court  has concentrated on identifying  the entity  responsible  for the military  \\noperation  or action in question, that is to say the  entity  which held ultimate  authority  and control . \\n133.

The Court  reached a similar  conclusion in  Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc.  \\nv. Switzerland  [GC] , 2016 . The applic ant was an  Iraqi  national who had been  responsible  for the  \\nfinances of the Iraqi  secret services under Saddam Hussein ’s regime and for a company which he had \\nowned. The applic ants  having been  included on the  lists of sanctions a ppended to UNSC  Resolution  \\n1483 (2003) concerning  Iraq, their assets  in Switzerland  had been frozen and made subject to  a \\nconfiscation  procedure . The Swiss Federal  Court had merely checked whether the applic ants ’ names \\nduly appeared on the  lists drawn up by the S anctions Committee  and whether the assets in \\nquestions belonged to them . That court had , on the other hand , refused to consider their  allegations  \\nregarding the  compatibility  of the  procedure  used to  confiscate  their assets with the  fundamental  \\nsafeguards  on a fair trial set out in the  Convention. The Federal  Court had invoked  the absolute  \\nprecedence of the obligations stemming from  the UN  Charter  and the  decisions  taken by the UNSC \\nunder that Charter  over any other standard of  international  law, and the very  precise  and detailed  \\nnature of the  obligations imposed on S tates by the Resolution , which left them no margin of \\ndiscretion. The  Court  considered that such  resolutions  should always be  interpreted on the basis of \\nthe (rebuttable ) presumption  that the UNSC does not intentionally  impose  on S tates an obligation \\ncontravening  the fundamental  principles  of human rights . Therefore , when a  resolution  contains  no \\nclear  and explicit  exclu sion or  limita tion of respect for human rights in the framework of the \\nimplementation of sanctions, it must always  be understood as authorising the courts of the \\nrespondent State to exercise su fficient scrutiny to avoid  any arbitrariness . Consequently , to that \\nextent , Switzerland  had been  responsible  for a possible  violation of the right to a fair trial . \\nC.  Imputability  of the alleged  violation to other  international  \\norganisations  \\n141.  As regards other  international  organisations , the Court  has always adopted a  differential  \\napproach , drawing a distinction  between two types of case . \\n142.  Where the applic ant complains about a structural deficiency  in the  internal workings of the  \\ninternational  organisation in question , the Court  appli es the  Bosphorus  presumption , which involves  \\nverifying whether the S tates, when transferring some of their  sovereign  powers to the relevant  \\ninternational  organisation , ensured that the rights secured under the  Convention were afforded  \\nprotection equivalent  to that of the  Convention ( Gasparini  v. Italy and Belgium  (dec.) , 2009 ; Rambus \\nInc. v. Germany  (dec.) , 2009 ; Klausecker  v. Germany  (dec.) , 2015 ). \\n143.  On the other hand , where the applic ant complains not about of a  structural  deficiency in the \\ninternal  machinery of th e international  organisation in question but about a specific  decision  taken \\nwithin that organisation , the application is  incompatible ratione personae  with the provisions of the \\nConvention (Boivin  v. 34 member States of the Council of Europe  (dec.) , 2008 ; Connolly  v. 15 member \\nStates of the European Union  (dec.) , 2008 ; Beygo  v. 46 member  States of the  Council  of Europe  \\n(dec.) , 2009 ; López Cifuentes  v. Spain  (dec.) , 2009 ).

In such circumstances, the Court could  draw inferences from the \\navailable material and the authorities ’ conduct and found  the applicant ’s allegations sufficiently \\nconvincing and established beyond reasonable doubt  (ibid., §§ 165-167).  \\n146.  Reference is made  in this connection  to Rule 44A of the Rules of Court, which provides that the \\nparties have a duty to cooperate fully in the conduct of the proceedings and to take such action \\nwithin their power as the Court considers necessary for the proper administration of justice. \\nMoreo ver, pursuant to Rule 44C § 1, where a party fails to adduce evidence or provide information \\nrequested by the Court or to divulge relevant information of its own motion or otherwise fails to \\nparticipate effectively in the proceedings, the Court may draw su ch inferences as it deems \\nappropriate. Rule 44C § 2 plainly states that the failure or refusal by a respondent Contracting Party \\nto participate effectively in the proceedings shall not, in itself, be a reason to discontinue the \\nexamination of the applicati on. It is clear from the well -established case -law of the Court and from \\nRules 44A and 44C that if a respondent Government fail to comply with a request by the Court for \\nmaterial which could corroborate or refute the allegations made before it and do not d uly account \\nfor their failure or refusal, the Court can draw inferences and combine such inferences with \\ncontextual factors  (Ukraine and the Netherlands  v.

There are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre -determined formulae \\nfor its assessment: the Court has complete freedom in assessing not only the admissibility and \\nrelevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it. The Court adopts those \\nconclusion s of fact which are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all material before it \\nirrespective of its origin, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ \\nsubmissions and conduct  (Ukraine  v.

In the case of  Aliyeva and Aliyev  v. Azerbaijan , 2014, the Court  had before it an application from \\nthe parents of an  Azerbaijani  national who had been killed in Ukraine under  circumstances  \\nimplicating  two other  Azerbaijani  national s. Pursuant  to a mutual legal assistance agreement \\nbetween Ukraine and Azerbaijan , the case had been  transmitted  to Azerbaijan , but in the absence of \\nevidence the  Azerbaijani  authorities  had discontinued the proceedings  against the  suspect s. The \\nCourt  raised  of its own motion  the issue of its jurisdiction  ratione loci , considering  that in so far as  \\nAzerbaijan  had accepted  the obligation to conduct an investigation under  the 1993 Minsk \\nConvention to continue the criminal investigation commenced by the Ukrainian authorities, it was \\nbound to conduct such an investigation in compliance with the procedural obligation under Article 2  \\nand had undertaken  to continue  the criminal investigation  commenc ed by the  Ukrainian  authoritie s, \\nregardless  of where the death had occurred . Therefore, the  jurisdiction  of Azerbaijan  within the \\nmeaning of A rticle  1 came into play only to the extent that the  Azerbaijani  authorities  had decided  to \\ntake o ver the proceedings previously  opened by  Ukraine, under the  applicable international treaty \\nand domestic law (§§ 55-57). \\n43.  In the case of  Güzelyurtlu  and Others  v. Cyprus and Turkey  [GC], 2019, conce rning the murders \\nof several former residents  of the  “Turkish  Republic  of Northern Cyprus ” (“TRNC”) in the  territory of \\nthe Republic of Cyprus , the TRNC  authorities  had initiated their own investigation  into those \\nmurders , thus creating a  “jurisdictional  link” between the applic ants and Turkey , which incurred the \\nlatter ’s responsibility  vis-à-vis the acts and omissions of the “TRNC ” authorities . Moreover , there \\nwere “special features” related to the situation in Cyprus . First of all , the international community \\nregards Turkey as being in occupation of the northern part of Cyprus , and does not recognise the \\n“TRNC” as a State under international law. Northern  Cyprus is under the effective control of Turkey \\nfor the purposes of the Convent ion. Second ly, the murder suspects had fled to the “TRNC” and as a \\nconsequence, the Republic of Cyprus had been prevented from pursuing its own criminal \\ninvestigation in respect of those suspects and thus from fulfilling its Convention obligations . Having \\nregard to those “speci al features ” and to  the initiation of the investigation by the “TRNC”  \\nauthorities , the Court considered  that Turkey ’s jurisdiction under Article 1 of the Convention was \\nestablished  (ibid., §§ 191-197).  \\n44.  In the case of  Romeo Castaño  v. Belgium , 2019, the applic ants com plained  of the Belgian  \\nauthorities ’ refusal  to execute  a European  Arrest Warrant issued by the Spanish  authorities  against  a \\nperson suspected  of having been a member of the ETA terrorist  organisation , who had allegedly  \\nbeen involved in the murder of the  applicants ’ father in Spain and who lived  in Belgium , thus \\nprevent ing the commencement of criminal  proceedings against h er in  Spain . Unlike the \\naforementioned cases of Güzelyurtlu and Others  and Rantsev , the complaint lodged under the  \\nprocedural  limb of A rticle 2 had not been based on any alleged failure on the part of Belgium  to \\nhonour  a procedural  obligation to investigate that murder itself . Nevertheless , the Court  considered \\nthat the  principles  set out in the above -mentioned judgments  as regards the  determination  of the \\nexistence of a “jurisdictional  link” with the respondent should  apply  in th at case mutatis mutandis . \\nGiven that the  person  suspected  of the murder had fled to  Belgium  and that the Spanish  authorities  \\nhad asked their opposite numbers in  Belgium  to arrest  and surrender  her in the framework of the \\nEuropean  Arrest  Warrant  system, which was binding on b oth S tates, the Court  conclu ded that those  \\n“speci al features ” were sufficient  to hold that there was a “jurisdictional  link” between the \\napplic ants and Belgium  (ibid., §§ 38-42). \\n45.  In the case of Hanan  v. Germany  [GC], 2021, the Court  considered the existence of a  \\n“jurisdictional  link” in the light of the  principles  set out in the  Güzelyurtlu and Others  judgment . In \\nHanan , which solely concerned the procedural  limb of A rticle 2, a German  colonel  operating within \\nthe International Security  Assistance Force (IS AF) under a mandat e issued by the Security  Council  of \\nthe Unite d Nations pursuant to Chapter  VII of the UN  Charter , had ordered  an airstrike on two fuel '"
